      <p>B.Tech CSE-AIML (2nd Year)<br>Dronacharya Group Of Institution, Greater Noida<br>sah.hil1104@gmail.com  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  9304767392</p>
      <h5>Hi, I'm Sahil Verma, a Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Dronacharya Group of Institutions, Greater Noida. I'm deeply passionate about technology and constantly strive to explore and learn new advancements in the tech world.

        In addition to my academic journey, I've completed two internships in web development, where I honed my skills in front-end and back-end technologies, contributing to real-world projects and collaborative teams. I’ve also held a general management role in NGOs, gaining valuable experience in leadership, coordination, and community engagement.
        
        Outside the tech sphere, I'm equally passionate about the stock market. I aspire to become a successful stock market trader, and I actively dedicate time to understanding market trends, investment strategies, and financial planning.
        
        I believe in continuous growth, whether it’s through coding, leading teams, or analyzing the financial markets — and I’m excited about the journey ahead.</h5>
